# Authentication Basics

## Personal Notes/Thoughts as I read through the TOP Authentication-Basics lesson

[Everything you need to know about the `passport-local` Passport JS Strategy](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-passport-local-passport-js-strategy-633bbab6195)

- Authentication choices

  - Session - Cookie in client browser, 'Session' on server
  - JWT - JSON web token stored in browser, decoded by server
  - OAuth - 'Claims' generated by other application to authenticate user. Federated authentication with main authentication provided by large provider like Facebook, Google, GitHub, etc.

- Basic tenets of session based authentication:

  - Basic HTTP header protocol
  - Cookies
  - Sessions
  - How cookies and sessions interact

- The user specifies the URL, or clicks it through a link. The browser then attaches other headers to it to specify formatting, device settings, and QoL concerns that make sites able to fluidly adapt to any situation. Headers also appear to specify relevant cookies to let the server know the users permissions and preferences. On first blush this seems invasive but in reality it is necessary for maintaining user specified settings and access to prevent jumping through hoops every time. It's an opportunity cost thing.
- Request headers are 'instructions for the server'
- Response headers are 'notes/details about returned content'
